========================================
TASK:
You are an expert in Scientific Coding and Inverse Problems.
Extract MULTIPLE reusable skills from this trajectory.
Do NOT limit yourself to just one skill.
The goal is to distill high-quality, task-agnostic wisdom that can be applied to future inverse problems.

STRUCTURE YOUR ANALYSIS AROUND THESE 4 DIMENSIONS (Extract skills for each if relevant):

1. **Data Preprocessing & Loading**:
   - How was data format discovery handled? (e.g., handling unknown .npy structures, missing metadata)
   - What normalization or padding strategies were critical?
   - Any specific handling of complex/real-world data artifacts?

2. **Forward Modelling**:
   - How was the physics model implemented efficiently? (e.g., vectorization, FFT usage, padding for convolution)
   - Were there tricks for boundary conditions or discrete approximations?

3. **Inverse Processing (The Core Algorithm)**:
   - What optimization strategy worked? (e.g., ADMM, Gradient Descent, PnP, Unrolling)
   - Specific tricks for parameter tuning, step-size selection, or initialization?
   - How were gradients or adjoints verified?

4. **Post-processing & Evaluation**:
   - How were results visualized or metrics calculated?
   - Any specific cropping, de-padding, or thresholding steps required for valid evaluation?

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERALIZATION:
1. **Abstract away specific task details**: Do NOT use specific dataset names (e.g., "DiffuserCam", "SimDataset"), specific file paths, or specific dimensions (e.g., "64x64") in the skill name or applicability.
2. **Focus on the Pattern**: Identify the underlying pattern.
   - *Bad*: "Fixing the 64x64 array mismatch in DiffuserCam"
   - *Good*: "Handling Shape Mismatches in Convolutional Forward Models"
3. **Granularity**: Mix high-level workflow skills with low-level technical tips.
